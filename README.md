# Extatic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/avdgaag/extatic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/avdgaag/extatic)

A static site generator that transforms plain text input files into a
functioning website. Intended to be used for my own blog as a replacement for a
collection of Ruby scripts implemented as Rake tasks.

Currently, the only part that's implemented is `Extatic.Exdown`, the
Markdown/AsciiDoc-like plain text markup language that can be transformed to
HTML.

Documentation can be generated
with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) and can be found online
at [http://avdgaag.github.com/extatic](http://avdgaag.github.com/extatic).
